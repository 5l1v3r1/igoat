plistRename
======================================


Description
------------

Simple command line tool to rename strings inside plist left off by `ppiOS-Rename` tool. PPiOS-Rename only obfuscates {.m, .h, .storyboard, .nib, .xib and CoreData files.}. 


Usage
------------
    `plistRename -map <symbol-path> -plist <plist-file-path> -key <key-to-find>`
    where:
        `<symbol-path>` - file path of symbol map (JSON format) generated by PPiOS-Rename
        `<plist-file-path>` - file path of the plist.
        `<key-to-find>` - the key corresponding to the value to obfuscate. All instances will be replaced with the new value. Limited to strings only. 

### Example
    In Assets.plist, we need to obfuscate as well the value of the key "initialViewController" which is the name of the ViewController that will be displayed at runtime. 
    
    `plistRename -map symbols.map -plist Assets.plist -key initialViewController`

### Result
    The file Assets_obfuscated.plist will be generated (name suffixed with `_obfuscated`), in the same directory as the input plist. 
    The plist value of "initialViewController" is copied and its obfuscated value is written in the same heirarchy as the original. The corresponding key is prepended with `_`.
